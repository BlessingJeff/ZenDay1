1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP2:
HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.

In HTTP2 response time is short compared to HTTP 1.1.

HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1.1

HTTP2 is binary, instead of textual.

HTTP1.1:
HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection.

In HTTP 1.1 response time is high.



2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects are complex and each object may contain a combination of primitive datatypes as well as reference datatypes.
An object is a reference data type.
Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value.
That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored.
The variables donâ€™t actually store the value.

Objects defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of key & value pairs. 
These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods.
